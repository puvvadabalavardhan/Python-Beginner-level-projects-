🐍 Python Beginner-Level Projects
A collection of interactive Python applications ranging from utility tools to logic-based games. This repository showcases the fundamental building blocks of Python programming, including data structures, control flow, and algorithmic logic.
🚀 Featured Projects
| Project | Description | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| Strong Password Generator | Creates highly secure, randomized passwords. | Character randomization, length customization. |
| Message Encryptor & Decryptor | A security tool using Caesar Cipher logic. | String manipulation, indexing, loops. |
| Highest Bid Calculator | A "blind auction" program for multiple users. | Dictionaries, user input handling. |
| Guessing Game (Followers) | A "Higher or Lower" game based on social media stats. | Logic comparisons, list processing. |
| Rock, Paper, Scissors | A classic game played against the computer. | Random module, conditional branching. |
| Calculator | A robust CLI tool for arithmetic operations. | Functions, recursion, float handling. |
🛠 Technical Skills Demonstrated
Building these projects required a deep understanding of core Python concepts:
 * Logic & Control Flow: Using if/else, while loops, and for loops to manage program execution.
 * Data Structures: Organizing information using Lists and Dictionaries.
 * Functional Programming: Writing reusable, clean code through custom functions and parameters.
 * User Interaction: Mastering the input() and print() functions to create an engaging CLI experience.
📂 How to Use
